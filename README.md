 <!--### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo) -->

<h2>Description</h2>
Simple script utilzing the os library to organize your files in a folder to specific categories. Script is easily changed to fit your needs by changing the categories you want and the wait time between moving the files around. I also incorportated a feature that makes sure the file is finished downloading to make sure it does not attempt to move the file while it's still downloading, which will result in an error.
